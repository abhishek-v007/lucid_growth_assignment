Cosmo Digital," 2x your email marketing results or you don't pay  


Hey there 

B2B email marketing suffers from 1% response rates and <20% open rates.

... and we've all come to get used to those stats.

So what happens? Thousands of sales and marketing pros 'spray & pray'.

...""if I get 1% response rate, that must mean I need to send 100x the number of emails, right?"".

There is a lot of money being left on the table... Why? Because email marketing isn't run thoughtfully. 

Cosmo Digital is on a mission to EDUCATE sales and marketing teams to enable them to build predictable, long term 'lead generation machines'. 

I'll level with you. There's no secret sauce. The work is boring for many and sometimes time consuming.

....But it works. & it's the reason why educated sales and marketing teams land in their prospects inbox and get responses. 

This leads to higher number of discovery calls/demo's and sales in the pipeline.

If you'd like to learn more about the critical steps you must take before commencing any email marketing campaign then book an initial free consult via our website (cosmodigital.co).

Marketing by Minal,"Does the thought of creating your first email newsletter make you want to run for the hills?

I get it. Trying something new is scary. And putting yourself out there is even worse.

But you know that you need to get started. 

Social media just isnt cutting it for you anymore. 

And besides, you need to start building your own database of contacts. You know, the ones you can communicate with on your own terms.

But you just keep putting it off because it feels like its too big for you to do on your own.

Thats where I come in! Ive been helping small business owners, like you, use email marketing since 2012. In fact, Ive helped hundreds successfully launch a newsletter they LOVE putting together.

Small business owners love working with me. Heres what some of the people Ive helped have said:

We couldnt be happier with our newsletter. Previously, I tried to do it on my own and it took me so much time. Since we have started working together, it is so much easier to concentrate each month on just getting it done, thanks to your reminders and speedy newsletter service!

Working with Minal has shown me that nurturing my email list is invaluable to me. Its been a steep learning curve, but I now have a consistent format and I really understand what my readers like. This, in turn, has helped me give them the content they love, and make sales. It really has been an eye opener.

Without your course, it would have taken me 5 or 6 years to get to anywhere near where I am now with my newsletter. I now have an effective email that people want to read.
